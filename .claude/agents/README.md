2. **technical-research-specialist** conducts comprehensive research
3. **devops-tools-specialist** validates practical implementation
4. **content-creation-specialist** creates final presentation content

## Usage Guidelines

### Automatic Delegation
Agents are configured for automatic delegation based on task recognition. Claude will automatically use the most appropriate agent for your requests.

### Explicit Invocation
You can explicitly request a specific agent by mentioning their name:
- "Use the technical-research-specialist to research the latest Terraform features"
- "Have the content-creation-specialist create a new slideshow about Kubernetes"

### Best Practices
1. **Research First**: Always let research agent gather information before content creation
2. **Validate Technically**: DevOps tools expert should validate all technical examples
3. **Optimize for Presentation**: Consider both technical accuracy and slide presentation format
4. **Coordinate Changes**: Site structure changes should involve multiple agents

## Quality Standards
- All technical information must be research-verified and practically tested
- Content must be current, version-appropriate, and implementable
- Presentations must be optimized for both technical accuracy and audience engagement
- All multimedia content must be performance-optimized for GitHub Pages

## Current Project Context
- Hugo-based slideshow site using reveal-hugo theme
- Technical presentations on DevOps tools: Terraform, Docker, AWS, Kubernetes, etc.
- GitHub Pages deployment to `scrambledbits.github.io/slideshows/`
- Target audience: DevOps engineers and infrastructure professionals
