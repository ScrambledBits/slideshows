## Advantages of Using the Diagrams Python Tool

------
### Define as code, not as a drawing
As engineers, we are prone to not be very savvy about design tools and having to learn one
just to create a simple infrastructure diagram for documentation can be taxing and
time consuming.

------
### Code can be commited
Most likely you're already using some sort of version control system (git, svn, mercurial, etc)
and you would like to keep using it for eveything else, commiting diagrams in this way is
as simple as adding new python files to your project.

------
### Can consume data to create diagrams
You can easily plug this into any other python scripts you may have to easily and
automatically create architecture diagrams that change with the actual architecture.
