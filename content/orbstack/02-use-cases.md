## Primary Use Cases

### Docker Development Workflow
- **Local development** with Docker Compose
- **Multi-architecture builds** (x86/ARM)
- **Volume mounting** with near-native file performance
- **CI/CD testing** locally before deployment

### Linux Development Environments
- **Full Ubuntu/Debian machines** for cross-platform development
- **Package testing** across different Linux distributions
- **Legacy system compatibility** with 32-bit support
- **Network isolation** and custom configurations

### Migration Scenarios
- **Docker Desktop replacement** (automatic container migration)
- **Colima users** seeking better performance
- **VMware Fusion alternatives** for Linux VMs
- **Performance-critical workloads** requiring fast I/O

{{% note %}}
OrbStack excels in specific scenarios where performance matters. For Docker development, it provides seamless compatibility with Docker Compose and multi-architecture builds while delivering significantly faster file I/O for volume mounts. Linux machines are perfect for cross-platform development, testing across distributions, and running legacy 32-bit applications. Many teams migrate from Docker Desktop for licensing reasons or performance gains, while others switch from Colima or VMware Fusion for OrbStack's superior macOS integration and speed.
