Using Regula is pretty straightforward. You start by writing your IaC configurations. Then, you'll need to install Regula either on your local machine or directly in your CI/CD pipeline. Once installed, you run Regula against your configurations. The tool will then generate a report detailing any non-compliance issues. All you need to do is review and act on these results to keep your infrastructure compliant and secure.
