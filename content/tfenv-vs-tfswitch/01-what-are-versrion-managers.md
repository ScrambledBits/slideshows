Version management is a critical aspect of working with Terraform, as different projects or environments may require different Terraform versions to function properly. This can be due to new features, deprecated functionality, or compatibility issues with various providers. Using the appropriate Terraform version for each project ensures consistent behavior and reduces the risk of unexpected errors or infrastructure changes. Therefore, it's essential to have a version manager that can easily handle multiple Terraform versions and switch between them as needed.
