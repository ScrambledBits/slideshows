- Version management:
It simplifies the process of installing and managing multiple Terraform versions. Like tfenv, it enables users to list all available versions, install specific versions, and easily switch between installed versions. However, unlike tfenv, tfswitch does not support uninstalling versions directly.

- Easy-to-use interactive CLI:
tfswitch stands out with its interactive CLI, which allows users to select and switch between Terraform versions quickly and easily. Users can search for a specific version or select from a list of installed versions, making the process more user-friendly and less reliant on memorizing version numbers or command syntax.

- Installation:
tfswitch can be installed using package managers like Homebrew for macOS or by downloading the appropriate binary for your operating system (macOS, Linux, or Windows). The installation process is well-documented, making it easy for users to get started with the tool.

- Written in Go:
tfswitch is written in Go, which makes it easy to install and use on most Linux distributions. It also means that it can be easily extended with Go scripts, allowing users to add custom functionality as needed.
