Version management:
Both tfenv and tfswitch provide similar functionality in terms of managing multiple Terraform versions. Both tools enable users to list available versions, install specific versions, and switch between installed versions. However, tfenv supports uninstalling Terraform versions directly, while tfswitch does not.

Automatic version switching:
tfenv offers automatic version switching based on a project's ".terraform-version" file, ensuring that the correct Terraform version is always used for each project. tfswitch, on the other hand, does not have this feature and requires users to manually switch between versions using the interactive CLI or the optional ".tfswitchrc" configuration file.

Interactive CLI:
tfswitch stands out with its easy-to-use interactive CLI, allowing users to search for specific versions or select from a list of installed versions. This feature makes the process more user-friendly and less reliant on memorizing version numbers or command syntax. tfenv does not provide an interactive CLI, and users must input commands to switch between versions.

Platform support:
Both tfenv and tfswitch support macOS, Linux, and Windows (tfenv through Windows Subsystem for Linux and tfswitch with native Windows support). This ensures that users can choose either tool regardless of their operating system.

Community and support:
Both tfenv and tfswitch are community-driven projects with active development and support. Users can find extensive documentation, issue tracking, and contributions from the community for both tools, ensuring that they remain up-to-date and compatible with the latest Terraform releases and features.

Installation:
tfenv can be installed using various package managers, such as Homebrew for macOS or Git for Linux and macOS. The installation process is straightforward and well-documented, making it accessible for users of all experience levels. tfswitch can be installed using package managers like Homebrew for macOS or by downloading the appropriate binary for your operating system (macOS, Linux, or Windows). The installation process is well-documented, making it easy for users to get started with the tool.
